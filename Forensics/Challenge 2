🔒🚀So, are you all geared up for the next challenge?!
Let's get going Cyber Warriors!🔥🥳

🚩Challenge Description:
Your second challenge is related to forensics.
Digital forensics is the application of  analysis techniques to gather evidence from a particular computing device in a way that is suitable for presentation in a court of law. 
The goal of  forensics is to perform a structured investigation and maintain a documented chain of evidence. 

🚩 Cryptographic hashing is the practice of transforming plain text into cipher text, for the purpose of security.🔑

🚩This challenge  is basically related to email forensics .So this email consists of a cryptographed hash value that needs to be decoded by the user. A Hash Value (also called as Hashes or Checksum) is a string value (of specific length), which is the result of calculation of a Hashing Algorithm. Hash Values have different uses. One of the main uses of Hash Values is to determine the Integrity of any Data.

🔐So, let's start with the challenge: Open the pdf provided to you to analyse the given evidence.
